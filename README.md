<h1> lmi4u - let me install for you </h1>

lmi4u is designed to Install basic kind of tools (my personal preffered) required in Bug Bounty. 
If you are getting a new system (linux) or a VPS, than it's for you. It will install on one command :)

<h1>Note:- </h1>

-> The bash_profile will work for some specific tools (tools which i added in my script), not for all tools. <br>


<h1><u><b>Installation:- </b></u></h1>

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/namx05/lmi4u
cd lmi4u
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
</pre>
