<h1> lmi4u - let me install for you </h1>

lmi4u is designed to Install basic kind of tools (my personal preffered) required in Bug Bounty. 
If you are getting a new system (linux) or a VPS, than it's for you. It will install on one command :)

<h1>Note:- </h1>

1.The bash_profile will work for some specific tools (tools which i added in my script), not for all tools. <br>
2.Please change the username in line 68 form "naman" to your username, if you want the dynamic wallpaper to work :)


<h1><u><b>Installation:- </b></u></h1>

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/cryptopekkaa/lmi4u

</pre>
